Things to do:

Front End:
  - Decide what we want for a front end
  - Android vs React Native?
  - Actually design the app

Back End:
    - Extra Database Features
      - Friends List
      - Transaction Comments?
  - Set up VM as server
    - DoC Cloudstack vs MS Azure vs AWS
    - DoC Cloudstack is free but ive heard it sucks, and im more familiar with AWS
  - Figure out Authentication (OAuth2) through facebook/google 
    - Get fb_id, names, email from FB.
    - Check if already exists user with that email
      - There is, and with the same fb_id => Normal login, no problem
      - There isn't one => create a new user!
      - There is, but with no fb_id => Associate?
      - There is, with a DIFFERENT fb_id (is this possible?) => ????
  - Set up socket connections
  - Configure SSL/HTTPS encryption (Maybe?)

Both:
  - Agree on interface / API for interactions between the front/back
  - Any extra features

Outline:
  Essential Features:
    - An app used to track expenses, both personal and shared.
    - i.e. people living together in a flat buying groceries together can split the bills
      multiple ways, or split by cost of items, etc.
      - Two ways of splitting:
        - Directly between users, and within "groups" created by users. Groups would be for
          frequent use amongt the same group of people. It is also possible to have normal user
          transactions split between more than 2 people.
    - Keeps track of net owed by each person.
    - Users can customize their default settings (e.g. whether you need to "sign"
      to accept a record, default currency, auto debt transfer, etc)

  Potential Features:
    - Ability to transfer debts
    - Daily reminders on how much is owed, or if you reach a self-set cap.
  
  Reach Features:
    - Scan receipts, parse/itemize.
    - Integration with payment systems (Monzo, Paypal?) to allow users to settle debts.
